Docker alpine php-fpm with `zip`, `gd` and `redis` installed and enabled.  
Image is based on the [`jitesoft/php`](https://gitlab.com/jitesoft/dockerfiles/php-fpm) image using PHP FPM and exposes port `9000` for FPM. If you require PHP (fpm or cli) and not the 
extensions enabled in this image, use the base image instead.
